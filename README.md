# DOCUMENT_DISTANCE
The document distance problem is a computational problem used to measure the similarity between two or more documents, which is useful for searching for similar documents, detecting duplicates such as Wikipedia mirrors, and plagiarism detection. By comparing the content of documents, it is possible to determine if they are identical or nearly identical, which can help identify cases of plagiarism or copyright infringement. This can be useful for academic institutions or other organizations that need to ensure that their employees or students are not engaging in plagiarism.
